Notes:

1. Move over processed data points to WebServer, don't upload them to the server
   from DataAnalysis.py, this should be done in WebServer.py

2. Ensure temperature is a float

3. Get Arduino to send a tag when valves and pump are open/on to calculate
   energy consumption

4. Check how to visualize multiple graphs in the same page

5. Add the 8AM reset function
